/*  275. H-Index 2
    Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher,
    write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
    According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia:
    "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each,
    and the other N - h papers have no more than h citations each."

    Example:
    Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
    Output: 3
    Explanation:
    [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
    Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each
    and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.

    Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

    Follow up:
    This is a follow up problem to H-Index, where citations is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
    Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?

    Hint: Expected runtime complexity is in O(logn) and the input is sorted.
