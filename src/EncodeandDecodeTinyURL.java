/*
    Note: This is a companion problem to the System Design problem: Design TinyURL.

    TinyURL is a URL shortening service where enter a URL such as
    http://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl and it returns to s short URL as
    http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk.

    Design the encode and decode methods for the TinyURL service.
    There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work.
    You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.
