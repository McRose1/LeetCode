Rainbow Sort 

i = 0 -> all letters to the left-hand side of i are all 'a's
j = 0 -> (j is actually the current index) all letters in [i, j) are all 'b's
k = n - 1 -> (all letters to the right-hand side of k are all 'c's)
unknown area is [j...k]

三个挡板：
a a | b | x x x | c 
[0, i): a
[i, j): b
[j, k]: unchecked elements 
(k, len - 1]: c
