/*  256. Paint House
    There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green.
    The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different.
    You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

    The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix.
    For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on...
    Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

    Note: All costs are positive integers.

    Example:
    Input: [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
    Output: 10
    Explanation: Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue.
                 Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.
