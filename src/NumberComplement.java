/*
    Given a positive integer, output its complement number.
    The complement strategy is to flip the bits of it binary representation.

    Note:
        The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
        You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.

    Example 1:
    Input: 5
    Output: 2

    Example 2:
    Input: 1
    Output: 0
